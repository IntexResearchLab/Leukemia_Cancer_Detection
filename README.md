📊 Dataset

The dataset contains microscopic images from the ALL-IDB2 database with two main categories: segmented (cropped leukemic cells) and non-segmented (raw images). The data is split into train, validation, and test sets for robust evaluation.

Due to the large size of the dataset, it is not included in this repository. You can download the prepared dataset here:

After downloading, organize the data as follows:

data/
├── segmented/
│   ├── train/
│   ├── val/
│   └── test/
└── non_segmented/
    ├── train/
    ├── val/
    └── test/

🧠 Deep Learning Models

Pre-trained models and training scripts are available in the following folders:

    models_on_segmented_data/ — Models trained on segmented dataset

    models_on_non_segmented_data/ — Models trained on non-segmented dataset

Included architectures:

    MobileNetV2

    VGG16

    DenseNet121

An ensemble approach combines these models to improve detection accuracy.
📱 Web Application

The web/ folder contains a Flask-based web application providing a user-friendly interface for:

    Uploading blood smear images

    Running predictions using the trained ensemble model

    Displaying prediction results

    Downloading the annotated images post-prediction
